other languages objects and funcitons are distinct things
but in js in many ways they are the same subject

OBJECTS AND THE DOT

how an object lives inside memory
an object is collection of values with given names 
an object can have proeprties and methods
a primitive sitting off of it is called a property eg boolean or number 
an object could have another object connected to it-
can also contain functions- methods

so object can contain:
- primitive "property"
- object "property"
- function "method"

these sit in memory
the core object will have an address and will have a reference to these proeprties
or methods sitting on object 

var person = new Object();

//going to use computed member access operator ([])
person["firstname"] = "Tony";

when use the equals tony its going to create that spot in memory and create 
that spot in memory and give it that name 
and this object gets a reference to the address of that location in memory
so it will know where firstName is in memory

this is one way to set and access properties
go to operator precedence Computer Member Access its very near the top
[] looks for the proeprty name on the object (can do more)

person["lastname"] = "Alicea"
var firstNameProperty = "firstname";
console.log(person[firstNameProperty])

remmeebr [] will take this object and look for a proeprty with this name

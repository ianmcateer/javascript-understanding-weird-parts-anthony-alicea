TYPES AND OPERATORS

js is dynamically typed language- 
you dont tell the engine what type of data a variable holds,
it figures it out while your code is running

variables can hold different types of data because its all figured out 
during execution phase

static type eg bool isNew = 'hello' // an error

//---------------------------------------//
PRIMITIVE TYPES
a type of data that represents a single value 
six types in javascript 

undefined represents lack of existence (shouldnt use this to set a variable)
null also represents lack of existence - better to use this to set a variable
boolean - true or false
number - floating point number 
string = sequence of characters
symbol - es6 


//---------------------------------------//
OPERATORS
a special function that is synitactially (written) differen
generally take two parameters and return one result 

eg var a = 3 + 4;
var a = 3 > 4;

+ and > is an operator which is actually a function  

//---------------------------------------//
OPERATOR PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY 

precedence- functions are called in order of precedence 
higher precedence wins 
associativity- what order an operator gets called in (left to right or right to left )

var a = 3 + 4 * 5;
console.log(a)

good link for this mdn operator precedence which has a table of operator precedence 
the one with the bugger number gets called first 
* is 14
+ is 13 


var a = 2, b =3, c =4;
a = b = c;

the answer is 4
= assignment operator has right to left associativity meaning that 
goes to the right first and call (b = c) first  
return is 4 this si what it (b = c) evaluates to - it is a function that returns a value 


(3+4) * 5

() has 19 in precedence rule

//---------------------------------------//
Coercion

coercion- converitn a value from one type to another
happpens often in js because it is dynamically typed
console.log('1' + 2)

it coerces the 2 to a '2' and puts them together

//---------------------------------------//
Comparison Operators
console.log(3 < 2 < 1)      // returns true 

less than operator is left to right associativity - the one to left gets run first

3 < 2 returns false 
false < 1

what does an operator try to do when i give it a value that it doesnt expect?
its going to try coerce it to a number 
false becomes (Number(false)) 0 

NaN not a number - not a primitive type but can treat it as one 

Coercion is nice but can be dangerous 

"3" == 3 // true- it will coerce if it can 

null and undefined dont coerce to 0 for comparison but do for other circumstances
eg null < 1 will return true  - causes confusion 

look at strict equality === and !==

=== compares two things but doesnt try coerce the values 


look at mdn quality comparisons and sameness

Object.is is coming in the future

//---------------------------------------//
EXISTENCE AND BOOLEANS

var a;
goes to internet and looks for a value 

if (a) {
    console.log('something is there')
}

if a is null undefined of "" then if statement will fail because a is nothing  

but if var could end up being 0 then problem bc the code wont run and 
0 isnt lack of existence but zero evaluates to false 

could do this...

if (a || a === 0) {
    console.log('somehting is there')
}


//---------------------------------------//
DEFAULT VALUES 

function greet(name){
    console.log('hello ' + name)
}

greet()


//helloundefined
the + when it saw string and undefined it coerced undefine to a string 

es6 intoduces syntax to set default value 

legacy way...

function greet(name){
    name = name || '<your name here>'
    console.log('hello ' + name)
}
greet('tony')
greet()

if name is undefined the OR operator 

undefined || 'hello'

it returns hello it returns the value that can be coerced to true

"hi" || "hello" //hi

so can use the OR to say if smth doesnt exists or if its an empty string or null
|| is run first before =

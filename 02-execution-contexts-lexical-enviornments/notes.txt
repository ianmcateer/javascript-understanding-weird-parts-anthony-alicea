SYNTAX PARSES, EXECUTION CONTEXTS AND LEXICAL ENVIORNMENTS

syntax parser- a program that reads your code and detemrines
what it does and if its grammar is valid
someone else wrote a program to translate it for the computer
so you have your code and then there is a program that converts this into
computer instructions to hardware readable code
syntax parser goes through character by character 

LEXICAL ENVIORNMENT
where something sits physically in the code you write
where you write something is important 
a variable sits lexically inside a function  

EXECUTION CONTEXT
a wrapper to help manage the code that is running
there are lots of lexical environments- the one currently running is managed 
via eecution contexts

Objects are important
name/value pairs
a name value pair is a name which maps to a unique value
the name may be defined more than once, but can only have one
value in any given context
that value may be more name/value pairs

eg Address = '100 Main St';

an object is just a collection of name/value pairs
that value might be another object
eg

Address:
    {
        Street: 'Main',
        Apartment: 
            {
                Floor: 3,
                Number: 301
            }
    }

THE GLOBAL ENVIORNMENT AND THE GLOBAL OBJECT
whenever code run inside js its run inside an execution context
meaning a wrapper that the js engine 
base execution context is the global execution context
global- the thing that is accessible to eveything in your code (its global)

the global execution context creates two things for you:
    1- global object
    2- 'this'


this in the browser points to the window object
this refers to the window object

if running js in node different global object

global: 'not inside a function'  

var a = 'hello world'
// available in global 

//funciton b available in the global object
function b() {

}

a and window.a are the same thing 

//-----------------------------------------------------//
CREATION AND HOISTING

b();
console.log(a)
var a = 'hello world';

function b() {
    console.log('called b')
}

OUTPUT:
called b
undefined

even though the function was below it still ran
this is called hoisting  

execution context is created in two phases
first phase is creation phase
global object setup and 'this' is created
outer environment created
in this creation phase recogniss wher eyou created variables and functions
sets up memory space for variables and functions - 'hoisting'
before code executed line by line js already set aside memeory space 
for the variables and funcitons you have created in the code 

when it comes to variables; function entirely is store din memory space
but when sets up memeory space for vairable a wont know what its value is 
until it  starts executing this code so instead puts a placeholder 
undeifned meaning idk what this value is yet 
all variables initially set to undefined functions set in memory in their entirety

NOTE: with let and const get reference error
let and const are hoisted but difference is they stay uninitialised
(not like var where they get initialised as undeifned)
they will only get initialised when they get evaluated 


JS AND UNDEFINED 
var a;
console.log(a)

// get undefined- this is a special value that js has ini it, means the variable hasnt been set

//-----------------------------------------------------//
EXECUTION CONTEXT

now runs the code you have wirtten line by line 
js is single threaded- one command at a time
when dealing with browsers js isnt the only thing happening in the browser

//-----------------------------------------------------//
EXECUTION STACK
invocation- is js by using ()

function b () {

}

function a () {
    b()
}

a()

first of all a global execution conext is created
then compiler will start up and create variable this, global object (window)
then in creation phase attach these to the window objec
ie it will set up memory space so b and a will be in memory
when hits a() it invokes a 

a new execution context is created and placed on the execution stack
its just a stack- one on top of the other
the one on top is the one currently running 
if have another funciton () then create another execution context 

every function creates a new execution context 

when finishes gets popped off the stack  

//-----------------------------------------------------//
FUNCTIONS CONTEXT AND VARIABLE ENVIRONEMNTS
variable enviornemnt- just talking about where the vairables live
where is the variable?
